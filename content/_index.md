Hi, I am Razhan<sub>(ɾɑʒɑn)</sub>, an MLOps engineer, currently learning about [Mechanistic Interpretability](https://github.com/RazhanHameed/MI_playground), an emerging field focused on understanding the internal mechanisms of neural networks. After completing my MSc in Artificial Intelligence from Queen Mary University of London (with Distinction as a Chevening Scholar), I started working as an MLOps Engineer designing and implementing end-to-end data pipelines and ML systems at scale.
<br>


In my free time, I focus on applying state-of-the-art techniques to low-resource languages. I have built [Automatic Speech Recognition](https://huggingface.co/spaces/razhan/whisper-ckb-demo), [LLMs](https://github.com/RazhanHameed/kurdish-llama), [Spell Checkers](https://github.com/RazhanHameed/kurd-spell), [OCR](https://github.com/RazhanHameed/kurdish-ocr) and [Text-to-Speech](https://huggingface.co/razhan/mms-tts-ckb) models for Central Kurdish. I have also collected and curated the data for each of these models as Central Kurdish is a low-resource language. Recently, I have been working on [DOLMA](https://dolma-nlp.github.io), a project to build multimodal translation systems for various underrepresented languages in the Middle East.<br>

In a previous life, I was a Tech Advisor at [51 Labs](https://fiveonelabs.org/) a start-up incubator that helps talented entrepreneurs in conflict-affected areas launch and grow their businesses in the Middle East.<br />
